🧑‍💻 Face Detection and Recognition AI

This project is an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos using the DeepFace library. It demonstrates modern face recognition pipelines without needing complex installations like dlib.

🚀 Features

Detect faces in images or webcam streams

Recognize and verify faces

Multiple pre-trained backends supported (OpenCV, Facenet, VGG-Face, ArcFace, etc.)

Interactive Streamlit UI
